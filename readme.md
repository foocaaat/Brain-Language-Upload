<h1>Binge-Studying? (Turn Language Study into a Captivating Watching Experience)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Do you find it hard to stay focused while studying a new language? Binge-Studying is an Anki addon that turns language study into a captivating watching experience. With this addon, you can study your favorite TV shows, movies, or any other video content with subtitles, and turn them into a language learning opportunity.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>MPV Playing Functionality</h3>
<p>The Binge-Studying addon has a great MPV functionality, making language learning an enjoyable and captivating watching experience. It detects the start and end of the timestamp, and will automatically play the selected speech section without interruption. Additionally, if a new card is presented, the addon will understand when to start the speech from the beginning, rather than from the selected start position.</p>
<h3>Timestamps and Subtitles</h3>
<p>Binge-Studying works by you putting "mkv" files inside a folder you choose and then getting timestamps from where speech happens in mkv TV series or film or anything that has subtitles. Then, it creates a txt file inside a stamp folder, which opens after the timestamps have been gathered. You can drag it to Anki to add your deck, and the addon has great watching MPV functionality.</p>
<h3>Custom Shortcuts</h3>
<h4>Navigation</h4>
<p>Binge-Studying comes with custom shortcuts that you can use for easy grading:</p>

  <li><strong>Up:</strong> Play timestamp without subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Down:</strong> Play timestamp with subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Right:</strong> Grade the card as again or good based on if you showed the subtitles or not</li>
  <li><strong>Left:</strong> Undo</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE:that when the card is new, whether you saw the subtitles or not, it is graded as good.</p>
<h4>Timestamp Editing</h4>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Binge-Studying changes the daily review order to be in creation date. When reviewing old cards, it will be like rewatching your shows but skipping the sentences that you already know.</p>
<h3>Card Type</h3>
<p>The Binge-Studying card type doesn't have a front, only a back card. The back card displays the text from the subtitles, along with the audio file of the selected timestamp.
