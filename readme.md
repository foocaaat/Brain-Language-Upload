<h2>Turn Language Study into a Captivating Watching Experience</h2>
<p>Are you tired of traditional language learning methods that feel tedious and dull? With Binge-Studying?, you can turn language study into a captivating watching experience. This addon allows you to put "mkv" files inside a folder of your choosing and get timestamps from where speech happens in TV series, films, or anything that has subtitles.</p>
<p>Once the timestamps have been gathered, the addon creates a text file inside a stamp folder that opens automatically. You can then drag this text file to Anki to add it to your deck. But that's not all. Binge-Studying? has a great watching MPV functionality that detects when to start and finish playing parts of the video. If it's a new card, it will understand when to start from the beginning rather than the start position. </p>
<p>The addon also has custom shortcuts that make grading easy:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Up:</strong> play timestamp without subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Down:</strong> play timestamp with subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Right:</strong> grade the card as again or good based on whether you showed the subtitles or not</li>
  <li><strong>Left:</strong> undo</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when the card is new, whether you saw the subtitles or not, it is graded as good. Additionally, Binge-Studying? has timestamp editing features that allow you to manually edit the timestamps if there is unsynced or chopped speech. With just a few simple shortcuts, you can easily make adjustments to timestamps and ensure that your learning experience is seamless.</p>
<p>The editing functionality includes the following shortcuts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>,</strong> set timestamp back 100ms at the start-position</li>
  <li><strong>.</strong> set timestamp forward 100ms at the start-position</li>
  <li><strong>[</strong> set timestamp back 100ms at the end-position</li>
  <li><strong>]</strong> set timestamp forward 100ms at the end-position</li>
</ul>
<p>The addon also changes the daily review order to be in creation date. This means that when reviewing old cards, it will feel like re-watching your shows, but skipping the sentences you already know. </p>
<p>To get started with Binge-Studying? follow these easy steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to tools and press "Select Video Location". Select the folder where all the mkv files are located.</li>
  <li>Go to tools and press "Turn New Videos into SRS". Wait for it to complete.</li>
  <li>Add the example deck which has the card type and styling (which is just the functionality to skip the front card).</li>
  <li>Create a new deck with any name.</li>
  <li>Make sure you select card type "Binge-Studying-Card" and import the card. You're done!</li>
</ol>
<p>The main purpose of this addon is to make language learning super easy. With Binge-Studying?, you won't need any other methods to learn a language. Try it out and turn language study into a captivating watching experience!</p>
