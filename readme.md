<h1>Binge-Studying?</h1>
<h2>Turn Language Study into a Captivating Watching Experience</h2>
<p>Are you tired of traditional language learning methods that feel tedious and dull? Do you wish there was a more fun way to learn a language? With Binge-Studying?, you can make language study into a captivating watching experience. </p>
<p>The addon works by allowing you to put "mkv" files inside a folder of your choosing and getting timestamps from where speech happens in TV series, films, or anything that has subtitles. Once the timestamps are gathered, the addon creates a text file inside a stamp folder that opens automatically. You can then drag this text file to Anki to add it to your deck. </p>
<p>Binge-Studying? has a great watching MPV functionality that detects when to start and finish playing parts of the video. If it's a new card, it will understand when to start from the beginning rather than the start position. The addon also has custom shortcuts that make grading easy. For example, "Up" plays timestamp without subtitles, "Down" plays timestamp with subtitles, "Right" grades the card as again or good based on whether you showed the subtitles or not, and "Left" is undo. </p>
<p>If there is unsynced or chopped speech, Binge-Studying? has timestamp editing features that allow you to manually edit the timestamps. You can set the timestamp back or forward 100ms at the start-position or the end-position. These four shortcuts make sure that you can quickly and easily edit any mistakes. </p>
<p>The addon also changes the daily review order to be in creation date. When reviewing old cards, it will feel like re-watching your shows, but skipping the sentences you already know. </p>
<p>To get started with Binge-Studying?, follow these easy steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to tools and press "Select Video Location". Select the folder where all the mkv files are located.</li>
  <li>Go to tools and press "Turn New Videos into SRS". Wait for it to complete.</li>
  <li>Add the example deck which has the card type and styling (which is just the functionality to skip the front card).</li>
  <li>Create a new deck with any name.</li>
  <li>Make sure you select card type "Binge-Studying-Card" and import the card. You're done!</li>
</ol>
<p>The main purpose of this addon is to make language learning super easy. With Binge-Studying?, you won't need any other methods to learn a language. Try it out and turn language study into a captivating watching experience!</p>
