<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Timestamps and Subtitles</h3>
<p>Binge-Studying works by you putting "mkv" files inside a folder you choose and then getting timestamps from where speech happens in mkv TV series or film or anything that has subtitles. Then, it creates a txt file inside a stamp folder, which opens after the timestamps have been gathered. You can drag it to Anki to add your deck, and the addon has great watching MPV functionality.</p>
<h3>Custom Shortcuts</h3>
<p>Binge-Studying comes with custom shortcuts that you can use for easy grading:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Up:</strong> Play timestamp without subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Down:</strong> Play timestamp with subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Right:</strong> Grade the card as again or good based on if you showed the subtitles or not</li>
  <li><strong>Left:</strong> Undo</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that when the card is new, whether you saw the subtitles or not, it is graded as good.</p>
<h3>Timestamp Editing</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>,</strong>: Set timestamp back 100ms at the start-position</li>
