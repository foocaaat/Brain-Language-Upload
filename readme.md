<h1>NEW Timestamp Auto Sentence Mine (helps you "not" look at subtitles)</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>You put 'mkv' files, it will output timestamps instructions to Anki/mpv and it will be played in the right order, (not red cards)
</li>
Â <br>
<li>It will be similar to rewatching your shows, but it skips easy stuff and focuses on your weaknesses, so no "valuable" time is used on sentence mining, instead immersing more,the anki will do the rest.</li>
<br>
<li>There is Only "one side to the cards", The user watches and the Addon will automatically grade cards as good or bad based on "whether they have seen subtitles." so you won't see the sub if you are Confident enought that you understand (which is good)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Custom Shortcuts</h3>

  <li><strong>Down :</strong> Play timestamp with subtitles</li>
  <li><strong>Right :</strong> Grade the card as again or good based on if you showed the subtitles or not</li>
